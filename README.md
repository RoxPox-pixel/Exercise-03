# Exercise-03-from-29-September-2024


In your local repository, create a folder called exercise-03. Inside the folder, add index.html & main.js files. The exercise should implement the following problem:

The user provides two numbers, in ascending order (!). The program outputs a single message containing the values between the given values.

Example: 
First Input value: 4
Second input value: 7
Output message: “4 5 6 7”

After implementing the solution, commit the changes and push them to the public repository (use a descriptive name for the commit)
